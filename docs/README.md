# About

Every open source project has its own style guide, a set of standards, for writing, and design of code, documentations, and assets.

It is better to understand a codebase when all the **documentation and code** is in a **consistent** style.

A style guide establishes and enforces style to improve the intelligibility and communication within the project community.

It ensures consistency and enforces best practice in usage and language composition.
