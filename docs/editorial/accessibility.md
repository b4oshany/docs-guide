# Accessible content

::: tip Key Point
:bulb: Write documentation that is accessible to people with disabilities.
:::

Write documentation with accessibility in mind, it improves the overall experience for all readers.

## General dos and don'ts

- Avoid ableist language. Avoid bias and harm when discussing disability and accessibility.
- Avoid unnecessary font formatting. (Screen readers explicitly describe text modifications.)
- Donâ€™t force line breaks (hard returns) within sentences and paragraphs. Line breaks might not work well in resized windows or with enlarged text.
- Avoid camel case and all caps. Follow capitalization guidelines.
- Don't use *&* instead of *and* in headings and text.

## Reading ease

- Break up walls of text to aid in scannability. For example, separate paragraphs, create headings, and use lists.
- Use shorter sentences. Try to use fewer than 26 words per sentence.
- Define acronyms and abbreviations on first usage and if they're used infrequently.
- Use parallel writing structures for similar things.
- Place distinguishing and important information of a paragraph in the first sentence to aid in scannability.

## Headings and titles

Use descriptive headings and titles because they help a user navigate their browser and the page.

- Use a heading hierarchy.
- Don't skip levels of the heading hierarchy. For example, put an `<h3>` only under an `<h2>`.
- Don't have empty headings or headings with no associated content.
- Use a level-1 heading for the page title or main content heading.

## Links

- Use meaningful link text. Links should make sense when read out of context.
- Don't use *click here* or *read this document*.
- Avoid adjacent links or put a character in between to separate them.

## Images

- For every image, provide alt text that adequately summarizes the intent of each image.
- Don't repeat images unless absolutely necessary.
- Don't present new information in images; always provide an equivalent text explanation with the image.

## Videos, recordings, and GIFs

- Avoid flickering or flashing elements. They can cause anything from motion sickness to a seizure.
