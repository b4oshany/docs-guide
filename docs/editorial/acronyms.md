# Acronyms

Acronyms and abbreviations can have an adverse effect on clarity, voice, and SEO.

Although some acronyms are widely understood and preferred to the spelled-out term,
others aren’t well known or are familiar to all readers.

## Use familiar acronyms

Use acronyms that your audience is familiar with.

The A–Z word list has guidelines for common acronyms, and some acronyms are so widely used that they’re in *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).*

## Spell out the term for clarity

Include the acronym in parentheses following the spelled-out term.

On subsequent mentions in the same topic, page, or screen, you can use the acronym without spelling it out.

Some acronyms, like *USB, FAQ,* and *URL,* are more well known than the spelled-out term.

Don’t spell out the term if the acronym is listed in *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/)*
or if the A–Z word list says to use the acronym without spelling it out.

### Examples

Conversation as a platform (CaaP) has the potential to make booking a flight as easy as sending a text message.
Developers are also looking to CaaP to make computing more accessible to users of all abilities.

Learn how to connect a USB device to your computer.

## Don’t introduce acronyms that are used once

If an acronym will appear only once in your content, spell out the term.

Don’t introduce it in parentheses after the spelled-out version.

**Exception** It’s OK to use both the spelled-out term and the acronym if both are needed for SEO, even if the acronym is used only once.

## Titles and headings

Avoid using an acronym for the first time in a title or heading, unless it’s a
keyword that you need to place in the title or heading for SEO.

If the first use of the acronym is in a title or heading, introduce the acronym
(in parentheses, following the spelled-out term) in the following body text.

## Lowercase

Lowercase all words in the spelled-out form of an acronym except for proper nouns.

The names of protocols and specifications are considered proper nouns and are capitalized when spelled out.

### Examples

- High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)

**Add *s* to make an acronym plural**

Form the plural of an acronym like you would any other noun.
If the acronym stands for a singular noun, add a lowercase *s* to make it plural.

If an acronym stands for a plural noun, don’t add an *s.*

### Examples

- Three APIs

## Avoid the possessive form

Unless an acronym refers to a person or an organization, avoid using the possessive form.

### Examples

- The IDE enhancements
- The purpose of the FAQ
- The CEO’s blog

::: tip
In machine-translated content, be careful with acronyms that form common English words, like *RAM.*

If the acronym appears outside of the parentheses and without the spelled-out version, it might be translated incorrectly.
