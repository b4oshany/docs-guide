# Contractions

::: tip Key Point
:bulb: It's OK to use contractions; but be wary of certain kinds of contractions.
:::

We write our documentation in an informal tone, feel free to use most types of contractions.

## Negation contractions

In particular, it's fine to use "-n't" contractions, such as "isn't," "don't," and "can't."

One reason that such contractions are useful: it's sometimes easy for a reader to miss the word "not," whereas it's harder to misread "don't" as "do."

## Noun+verb contractions

Avoid contractions formed from nouns and verbs.

**:thumbsup: Recommended:** Plone is fast and awesome.

**:thumbsdown: Not recommended:** Plone's fast and awesome.

Sometimes, it's OK to use a noun+verb contraction, such as "If you want to display information, a table's your best option."

It's best to avoid that kind of contraction.

**:thumbsup: Recommended:** The following guides are a good way to learn to use Plone.

**:thumbsdown: Not recommended:** The following guides're a good way to learn to use Plone.

Here, "guides're" just sounds clunky and weird.

## Don't use double contractions

Double contractions contain not just one but two contracted words. Some examples of double contractions are as follows:

- Mightn't've (mightn't have → might not have)
- Mustn't've (mustn't have → must not have)
- Wouldn't've (wouldn't have → would not have)
- Shouldn't've (shouldn't have → should not have)

## Its and it's

Don't confuse *its* with *it's*.
It's **not** right!
