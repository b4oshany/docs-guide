# Filenames and file types

:bulb: Use all-lowercase, and separate words with hyphens.

Make file and directory names lowercase.
Separate words with hyphens, not underscores.
Use standard ASCII alphanumeric characters in file and directory names.

## Referring to file types

::: tip Key Point
:bulb: Use the formal file type name, not the filename extension.
:::

When you're discussing a file type, use the formal name of the type.
(The file type name is often in all caps, because many file type names are acronyms or initialisms.)

Do not use the filename extension to refer generically to the file type.
