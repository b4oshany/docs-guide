# Link text

::: tip Key Point
:bulb: Use descriptive link text that is helpful to the reader.
:::

When you're writing link text, use a phrase that describes what the reader will see after following the link.
Links should make sense without the surrounding text.

That can take either of two forms:

- The exact title of the linked-to page, capitalized the same way the title is capitalized.
- A description of the linked-to page, capitalized like ordinary text instead of like a title.

::: warning Note
You have to rework a sentence to include a phrase that makes good link text.
:::

A couple of things to keep in mind about link text:

- Don't use the phrase "click here" or "this document." It's bad for accessibility and bad for scannability.
- Don't use a URL as link text. Instead, use the page title or a description of the page.

## Punctuation with links

If you have punctuation immediately before or after a link, put the punctuation outside of the link tags.
