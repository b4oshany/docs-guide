# Present tense

::: tip Key Point
:bulb: Avoid will.
:::

Use present tense rather than future tense; in particular, try to avoid using *will* where possible.

For example:

**:thumbsup: Recommended:** Send a query to the service. The server sends an acknowledgment.

**:thumbsdown: Not recommended:** Send a query to the service. The server will send an acknowledgment.

Sometimes, of course, future tense is unavoidable because you're actually talking about the future.
(For example: "The hedgehog will hibernate starting in October.")
Attempting to predict the future in a document is a bad idea, but sometimes it's necessary.

The fact that the reader will be writing and running code in the future isn't a good reason to use future tense.
Stick with present tense where possible, as shown in the "Recommended" example above.

avoid the hypothetical future *would*.

For example:

**:thumbsup: Recommended:** If you send an unsubscribe message, the server removes you from the mailing list.

**:thumbsdown: Not recommended:** You can send an unsubscribe message.
The server would then remove you from the mailing list.
