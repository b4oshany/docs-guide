:bulb: Write in US English, but write with translation and a global audience in mind.

Write in in US English.

## Write short, clear sentences

The shorter the sentence, the beter it is to understand.
English is shorter than most languages; an average length English sentence may result in a long sentence when translated, impairing understanding.

## Be consistent

If you use a particular term for a particular concept in one place, then use that exact same term elsewhere, including the same capitalization.
If you use different names for the same thing, translators may think you're referring to different concepts, and thus may use different translations.

Don't use the same word to mean different things.
In particular, avoid using the same word as both a noun and a verb in close proximity.

## Don't be too culturally specific

In particular, don't refer to specific holidays, cultural practices, sports, etc., unless you're certain they're known worldwide.
Avoid colloquialisms.
Phrases like "ballpark figure," "back burner," or "hang in there" can be confusing.
