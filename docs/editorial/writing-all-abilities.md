# Writing for all abilities

Understandable, uncomplicated design and crisp, clear content—is better for all readers to use,
so nearly every writing recommendation in this guide will improve accessibility.

Please pay special attention to the following guidelines.

## Meaningful and focused text

**Be especially clear and concise** in instructions for setup, basic features, input methods, and accessibility features.

**Lead with what matters most,** so readers know immediately where to focus their attention.

**Keep paragraphs short and sentence structure simple** —aim for one verb per sentence. Read text aloud and imagine it spoken by a screen reader.

**Use parallel writing structures for similar things.** For example, use singular nouns for each top-level heading. Or, use a verb to start each item in a list.

**Spell out words like** ***and, plus,*** **and** ***about.*** Screen readers can misread text that uses special characters like the plus sign (+) and tilde (~).

**Write brief but meaningful link text.** Be descriptive—links should make sense without the surrounding text.

**Do not force line breaks** (also known as hard returns) within sentences and paragraphs. They may not work well in resized windows or with enlarged text.

## Content structure and location

**Emphasize important points visually and stylistically.**
Lists, headings, and tables reinforce relationships between
concepts. Provide summary information about the table, and use
concise and specific column headings.

**Use heading styles** instead of text formatting. Heading levels communicate the hierarchy of content.

**Don’t use directional terms as the only clue to location.** *Left, right, up, down, above,* and *below*
aren’t very useful for people who use screen-reading software.
If you must use a directional term, provide additional text about the location, such as *in the* ***Save As*** *dialog box, on the* ***Standard*** *toolbar,* or *in the title bar.*
