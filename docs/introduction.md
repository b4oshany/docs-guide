## Editorial guide

Aim, to write friendly, and respectful without being overly colloquial or frivolous.
A voice that's casual and natural and approachable, not pedantic or pushy.

Be understandable, uncomplicated and crisp.

Don't try to write exactly the way you speak; you probably speak more colloquially and verbosely than you should write.

Aim for a conversational tone rather than a formal one.

Be human, let your personality show, be memorable; you can even be a little funny now and then.

Please remember that the primary purpose of the document is to provide information to someone who's looking for it.
